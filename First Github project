This is my first Github Project where the task is to create 3 files which is log.txt, code.txt and output.txt and push 2 files i.e., code.txt and output.txt on master branch. Here is the command which I used:
Since Git is already installed on ubuntu therefore Git was not installed
Created a folder using mkdir and named it as gitpractice
Initialized the git using gitinit command inside gitpractice folder
Added three folders log.txt, code.txt and output.txt using nano command and written text like "This is log folder, This is code folder and This is output folder" respectively. 
Used git add command only for code.txt and output.txt to adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.
Used git commit command only for code.txt and output.txt
Log in on Github and created repo gitnew. Copied the repo link for next step
Used command git remote add origin pasted the repo link
Used command git push orgin master
It asked for username so provided it
It asked for password which was shared from the token option on Github
Once entered username and password the two files were pushed on the Github repo

Challenges:
Need to remember syntax for Remote and push commands.
